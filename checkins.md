## Sprint #1
### This sprint I worked on: 
- I began to develop my web application. 
- I implemented Google OAuth login and logout functionality. 
- I connected to a weather API to generate a 5 day weather forecast for a given destination. 
- I created database in PostgreSQL.

### This sprint I learned: 
- I learned how to implement Google OAuth login functionality for secure user sessions. 
- I learned how to work with an API to pull in weather data.

### My successes this sprint were: 
- I began to develop my web application. 
- I successfully implemented Google OAuth login and logout functionality. 
- I connected to a weather API to generate a 5 day weather forecast for a given destination. 

### My challenge this sprint were: 
- I realized that it would be difficult to test my project, as I am creating a mobile application on a Windows machine and I have an Apple phone. I chose to change my project from a mobile application to a web application so that this challenge would be reduced. 
- I am unfamiliar with PostgreSQL, so I plan to work more with inserting and pulling data from it in the next sprint.
