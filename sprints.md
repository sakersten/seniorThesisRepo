## Sprint #1
### This sprint I worked on: 
- I began to develop both the backend and frontend of my web application.
- I made a basic frontend interface to test that data was being pulled correctly from my backend. 
- I implemented Google OAuth login and logout functionality. 
- I connected to a weather API to generate a 5 day weather forecast for a given destination (currently hardcoded for testing, but will eventually pull desination(s) from the database). 
- I created database in PostgreSQL.

### This sprint I learned: 
- I learned how to implement Google OAuth login functionality for secure user sessions.
- I learned how to work with API keys to fetch weather data for a given destination.  
- I learned how to work with API keys and .env files. 

### My successes this sprint were: 
- I began to develop both the backend and frontend of my web application. 
- I successfully implemented Google OAuth login and logout functionality. 
- I connected to a weather API to generate a 5 day weather forecast for a given destination. 

### My challenge this sprint were: 
- I realized that it would be difficult to test my project, as I am creating a mobile application on a Windows machine and I have an Apple phone. I chose to change my project from a mobile application to a web application so that this challenge would be reduced. 
- I am unfamiliar with PostgreSQL, so I plan to work more with inserting and pulling data from it in the next sprint.
